- 👋 Hi, I’m @BrickWithHat, a probably slightly to trigger happy chemist.
- 👀 I’m interested in just rolling about and learning as much as humanly possible.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a how to make my Stellaris mod even more advanced without overwriting a single file.
- 🍻 I'm open to talk to others or share my experiences but i prefer to do my thing on my own as it were.
